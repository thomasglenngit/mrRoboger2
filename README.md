## Description

_In this application, a user inputs a number. The output includes all numbers up to, and including the user's number with substitutions on particular numbers._

| Spec |      Input    |  Output |
|:----------|:-------------|:------|
| Return the name and input number from the user | "Joe Blow" 2 | "Joe Blow" 2 |
| Return an array from the user's input number | 4 | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| Replace all numbers containing a 1 with "Beep!" |  1 | "Beep!" |
| Replace all numbers containing a 2 with "Boop!" |   2  |  "Boop!" |
| Replace all numbers containing a 3 with "Won't you be my neighbour?" | 3 |  "Won't you be my neighbour?" |
| Numbers with consecutive number treatments, will still receive their respective treatments | 43 | "... 40, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my neighbour?"

## Known Bugs:

This page had a link to a French version that doesn't work, but worked pretty well going from the French to English version. I'm still trying to figure that one out... French version: https://thomasglenngit.github.io/monsieurR. 

It doesn't work, so I got rid of it. 

I have been trying to find out a way to filter out non-numeric entries and have come up short. However, I've left code in the document (coded-out) that I thought should work, but haven't been able to get it to do so. If you have any advice, please let me know.
